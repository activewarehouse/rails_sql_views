== Executing Tests

To run the tests either use:

  rake
 
Which will run the MySQL tests, or use something like the following:

  rake DB=native_postgresql
 
Substituting the directory name inside the connection directory.

== Status

Currently the following adapters have been tested:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL Pure Ruby
 
The Oracle and SQL Server adapters have not been tested by me.

== Implementing Adapters

If you would like to implement an adapter, it should go in lib/rails_sql_views/connection_adapters. Follow the conventions
of the other adapters currently implemented. Every adapter must implement the following methods:

  supports_views?
  views(name = nil)
  view_select_statement(view, name=nil)
  
The suports_views? method must return true. The views method must return an array of all view names. The view_select_statement method must return the select statement used to construct the specified view.

In addition you must include the following for testing purposes:

The script which establishes the database connection in ActiveRecord:

  test/connection/driver_name/connection.rb
  
The schema to setup the test database in your drivers native form:

  test/connection/driver_name/schema.sql
  
The expected schema output from a schema dump. Note that it must be formatted *exactly* as the output would be:
  
  test/schema.driver_name.out.rb
  
Once this is done you should send the diff of the changes to anthonyeden@gmail.com. Any questions can also be emailed to this address.

== Known Issues

* If you are running on Rails 1.1.6 then the schema dumper test will fail because the formatting of the schema output has changed between 1.1.6 and 1.2.
